# What the Shell?!

So, there's lot of terms that get thrown around: *shell, terminal, tty, command prompt*, etc.

+ They're basically just different names for the same thing.

+ They all refer to a **command line interface** (CLI). 

---

# Bash (i.e. Bourne Again Shell)

```bash
$ git config --system
```

---

# Create new Git repository 

```bash
$ git init new-repo # create new Git repo called new-repo

# For existing projects:
$ git init # in the project's root directory.

```
---

# Cloning an existing Git repository

```bash
$ git clone repo-URL
```

When you clone a repo, Git remembers where the original repo was. It does this by storing a **remote** in the new repo's configuration. A remote is like a browser bookmark with a name and a URL.

When you clone a repo, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the original repo.

Git keeps track of remote repos so that you can **pull** changes from those repos and **push** changes to them.

```bash
$ git pull origin master # you can specify which remote (origin, in this case) and which branch.
```

Always commit your local changes if you want `git pull` to run smoothly.

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

---

# Use Shell Commands

```bash
$ git status # Discover which file(s) have been changed since the last save.

$ git diff # Look at changes.

```

Git does not track files by default ... it wants until you've used the add command on them at least once before it starts paying attention.

The `status` command will tell you about files that are in your repo but aren't yet being tracked. 

```bash

$ git add FILENAME # Add file to staging area.

$ git commit -m "this is a message"

$ git log # press spacebar to continue down.

```

---

Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a hash.

A hash is like an absolute path. You can just use the first few characters to identify a hash (usually)

HEAD refers to the most recent commit. 

```
$ git log # retrieve hash

$ git show # enter first few characters of a hash, or HEAD~X

$ git annotate FILE # shows a list of all the changes to that particular file
```
---

# How can I see what changed between two commits?

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~2 # can use the hash characters here as well.

```

---

# Undo changes

To a file that has yet to be staged:

```bash
$ git checkout -- FILENAME # Will discard changes that have not been staged.
```

To a file that's already been staged:

```bash
$ git reset FILENAME # removes files from staging area.
$ git checkout -- FILENAME

# To put all files in your current directory back to their previous state:
$ git checkout -- . # the '.' is a placeholder for current directory. 
```
---

`git checkout` is used to undo the changes that you made since the last commit. This command can be used to go back even further into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit. 

The `--` is replaced by the commit hash. 

Restoring a file doesn't erase any of the repository's history. Instead, the act of restoring the file is saved as another commit, because you might later want to undo your undoing.

```
# To find the latest three commits involving this file:
$ git log -3 FILENAME 

# Checkout the file using the hash of the version you want to revert back to.
$ git checkout HASH FILENAME

$ git commit -m "write a message about your new commit"
```
---

# Branches

What is a **branch**? Branches allow you to have multiple versions of your work, and lets you track each version systematically. 

What happens in one branch does not affect other branches - until you **merge** them back together.

Every Git repository has a branch called `master`.

```shell
$ git branch # Lists all the branches for you (including master). Star beside branch you're currently in.

# Creating a new branch:
$ git checkout -b new-branch-name # also switches you to that branch.

# Differences between two branches:
$ git diff new-branch-name..master

```
---

# Merging branches

When you merge one branch (source) into another (destination), Git incorporates the changes made to the source branch into the destination branch. If those changes don't overlap, the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything from the source branch. 

```bash
$ git merge new-branch-name master # no '..' required.
```

---

# Flags

+ `-r` to compare to a particular revision

+ `-ammend` to change the previous commit message

```bash
$ ls -lh ~/Documents/
```


---

# Text editors

Nano

```bash

nano FILENAME

```
