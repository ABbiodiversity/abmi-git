# The Highest Ideal

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; *The goal is a collaborative, transparent, and efficient approach to our scientific and computational work at the ABMI.* 

&lt;br&gt;

We want to operationalize the **reproducibility** of our research.

We want staff to **collaborate** and learn from one another. 

&lt;br&gt;



Over time, we want staff from all corners of the organization to be able to contribute to and review the scientific products we create, as well as share their own projects.  

---

# Roadmap

**The Plan** (capital T capital P) is to:

1. Build skills with Git software among staff:

  + Develop curated list of Help resources;
  + Develop a nucleus of staff who can consistently provide support to others;
  + Meet (semi-) regularly to continue skill development. 

1. Introduce Git to the workflow of a few projects identified as good candidates.

1. Over time, build our analyses using Git as a collaboration tool and version control backstop, accessible by others both within and outside of the organization.

  ... something, something ...

# Git (in theory)

A **version control system** is a tool that manages changes made to files and directories in a project.

Many exist, but we'll focus on a particularly powerful one: **Git**.
&gt; If Dropbox and Word's *Track Changes* feature had a baby, Git would be that baby.

Git manages the evolution of a set of files in a highly structured way. 

--

&lt;br&gt;
Why's it useful?

+ Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, unless you work really hard at it.
+ Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, and notify you when your work conflicts with someone else's. 
+ Well designed for writing and tracking changes to code ... a common feature of many of our jobs here. 

---

# Key Git Terms

### **Repository**

Git projects have two parts: the files and directories you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 

The combination of these two things is called a *repository*, or 'repo' as the cool kids like Peter say. 

### **Stage** (or "add") and **Commit**

Git has a *staging area* in which it stores files with changes you want to save, but haven't been saved yet.
  
  &gt; It's like putting things in a box that you intend to mail out. 
  
*Commiting* those changes is like sealing up that box. Your changes are saved into the history of your local repo. 

---

# Key Git Terms

### **Pull**/**Push**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Repositories can be local (on your machine) or *remote*, i.e. hosted online by a service like Github (which we'll chat about right away ...)

A typical workflow:

  + You *pull* in your collaborators' work from a remote repository so that you have the latest version of everything.
  + You do some work.
  + You *push* your work back to the remote repository so that your collaborators can access it.

&gt; Pushing is like mailing out that box.

&lt;br&gt;
.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; These two commands were intentionally ordered in this way - it's good practice to Pull before you start work on a project, then Push when you're finished, even if you're working alone. If (when) you forget, there will be pain. Best to get in the habit.]

---

# Key Git Terms

### Many others ...

&lt;br&gt;
Conflicts

Branches

Forking

&lt;br&gt;
But we'll save these concepts for the next workshop(s).

---

# Github

**Git and Github are distinct things.**

  + [Github](https://www.github.com) is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
  
  + We can create, manage permissions to, and store our files in repositories hosted by Github.
  
  + Just like we don't *need* RStudio to run R code, we don't *need* Github to use Git - but it makes our lives much easier.

&lt;/div&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Other examples are Gitlab and Bitbucket.]

---

# Git(hub) for Scientific Research

In addition to the benefits of rigorous version control and collaboration tool, Git(hub) also helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility.

  +  *Nature:* [Democratic databases: science on GitHub](https://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719) (Perkel, 2016).
  + *PLOS:* [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and Github](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) (Perez-Riverol et al 2016)
  
Journals are increasingly moving towards stricter requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. 

  + No more frustrating reads of a tiny Methods section in a dusty old pdf file of a paper where you're trying desparately to understand what they did, step-by-step (.. *breathes heavily* ..).
  + You can host all the data, code, and writing for papers, projects, and/or reports in one place. Even [workshop materials](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/cure4git).

---

# Getting Started

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pics/so-it-begins-theoden.gif" height=420&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; Much like the battle of Helm's Deep, this will likely involve some up front pain. But you will emerge victorious.  

---

# Getting Started

.font80[Note: there are a ton of great Git resources online to you walk you through this process in depth. A bunch are listed in the [Resources](#resources) section at the back of this presentation and in the workshop's repo [README file](https://github.com/mabecker89/cure4git/blob/master/README.md), many of which are heavily borrowed from for this presentation.] 

### Register for a [Github](https://www.github.com) account.

  - It's free! Don't worry about the paid accounts for now&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

### Install Git on your local machine.

  - Depends on the OS you're running, but we'll assume Windows for this tutorial.
  - [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), aka 'Git Bash', is a recommended approach.
  
.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; You'll qualify for an educational account while you work for ABMI/UofA, which means you can create an unlimited number of private repos.]
  
---

# Getting Started

### Introduce yourself to Git.

Directly in the Shell (Git Bash):

```bash
$ git config --global user.name 'Marcus Becker'
$ git config --global user.email 'mabecker@ualberta.ca'
```
  
Or through R:


```r
# install.packages("usethis")
  
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Marcus Becker", 
               user.email = "mabecker@ualberta.ca")
```

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tips: Use your (real) full name, and the email associated with your Github account.

---

# Seamless Integration 

A wonderful aspect of RStudio is how well it integrates version control into your project workflow.

Git is a separate program to R, but RStudio connects them so well that you feel they are part of the same ecosystem.

You can use Git through the RStudio GUI, and in the background it executes the shell commands for you.

--

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Because of its simplicity&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, we'll introduce the use of Git through RStudio in this next section.

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are reasons why working with Git through RStudio is limiting. We'll touch on those next time when we work through some more advanced concepts.]

---

# General Recipe

*For new projects*

1. Create a repo on GitHub and initialize with a README.

1. Copy the HTTPS link (access vis the green "Clone or Download" button).

1. In RStudio, create a new Project using the following steps: 

  `File -&gt; New Project... -&gt; Version Control -&gt; Git` 
  
  and **clone** the repo to your local machine by pasting your copied link into the "Repository URL:" box.
  
1. Choose the project path (be intentional!) and click **Create Project**. 

&lt;br&gt;
&gt; See the gif walkthrough on the next slide.

# General Recipe

We've now cloned a remote repo from Github onto our local machine. Yay!

Remember those important command terms? (**Stage, Commit, Pull**, and **Push**) &lt;br&gt;
Let's execute them (Well, let RStudio execute them for us). 

.font90[1. Make a change to the repo README in RStudio ("Hello World!"). Save it.

1. Click the 'Git' tab in the `Environments, History, Connections .. ` pane.

1. Click `Commit`.

1. Click the `Stage` checkbox of the change you want to commit. 

  + You'll see a nice display of the changes you've either added (green) or deleted (red).

1. Write a `Commit message`. Be detailed. You never know when you'll need to know what you did in a particular commit. Commit the change.

1. Click `Pull` to retrieve any changes made by you or a collaborator in the upstream Github repo.

1. Click `Push`, which will send your changes to the remote repo on Github.]

# Recap

### What did we just do?

.font80[
+ Made some changes to a file locally 
+ Staged these changes 
+ Committed these local changes to our Git history
+ Pulled from the remote repo upstream
+ Pushed our shiny new changes out into the remote repo, accessible to our collaborators
]

--

### Why this workflow?

.font80[
+ Allows Github to act as the central node in the distributed version control network.
+ Copying project from Github to your machine automatically sets up the local Git repo for you.
+ RStudio Projects interact seamlessly with Git and Github.
  - e.g. The .RProj file acts as an anchor point for all other files in the repo, solving absolute vs. relative path problems&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

# What the Shell?!

What's RStudio doing in the background? 

It's executing a series of commands for you. But you can do these yourself.

There's a lot of terms that get thrown around: *shell, terminal, tty, command prompt*, etc.

+ They're basically just different names for the same thing (kind of).
+ They all refer to a **command line interface**.

You can type commands to your computer directly, rather than relying on a GUI. 

&lt;br&gt;
Why bother with the shell?

+ The shell is more powerful and flexible. You can do more.
+ Potentially more appropriate for projects that aren't (entirely) based in R.
+ Scripting with the shell is reproducible, while clicking within a GUI is not.
--
&lt;br&gt;
+ **You feel like a programming badass.** 

---

# What the Shell?!

There are many shell variants, but we'll focus on [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) (i.e. **B**ourne-**a**gain **sh**ell).

+ Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
+ Windows users should have it installed via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

When you open up the Bash shell, you'll be greeted by:
```bash
username@hostname: ~
$ 
```

# Repo tips

## README.md

+ You have the option to include a README when you create a repo in Github - do so!
+ README files act as landing pages for the repo, so you can (should) be explicit about the goals of the project/research, how to the run the analysis, etc. 
+ README's are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which Github automatically renders nicely for us.

## .gitignore

+ Tell Git what you want to ... ignore.
+ Useful if you have private files you would prefer not to be public (e.g. site location data).
+ Or for very large individual files (&gt;100 MB). These will cause RStudio to 'hang' (i.e. freeze up) when you try to push them to a remote repo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which you don't want.
+ Just a simple text file (save as .gitignore) in which you write the files you want ignored.  

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are [ways to handle large files](https://git-lfs.github.com/) when you're working in the shell, though.]

+ Say hello to Git.
+ Join the [ABbiodiversity](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity) Github organization.
+ Clone in to the [cure4git](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/cure4git) repository, either via RStudio or the Shell, and practice the recipe in slides 24-27 (write a line in the README).
+ Create a repo for one of your personal or work projects!

If (when) you run into trouble, holler at me. I will come and sit at your computer and we can troubleshoot together. See the [Resources](#resources) slide for some awesome Git How-To's.

---

# Next Workshop

Next time we will get into some juicier Git topics! 
+ Troubleshoot any issues people had (send me Q's beforehand if you want and I'll make sure to go over them in the slides). 
+ Introduce some advanced concepts.
+ Discuss potential for incorporating Git into ABMI projects and workflow.
