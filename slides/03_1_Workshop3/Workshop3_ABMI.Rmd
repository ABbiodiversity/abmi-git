# Key Git Terms (1)

### **Repository**

Git projects have two parts: the files and directories you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 

The combination of these two things is called a **repository**, or *repo* as the cool kids say. 

### **Commit**

You use Git to take snapshots of all the files in a repository.

When you want to take a snapshot of a file or files, you create a **commit**.

---

# Commit (cont'd)

When you **commit** a file or files, some information is saved along with the changes to the file:

1. Who
2. When

Plus, you can (should!) add more information about the changes you've made in a **commit message**.

---

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Remote**

With Git, repositories can be local (on your machine) or **remote**, i.e. hosted online by a service like [Github](https://github.com/).

How do you interact with a remote repository?

--

### **Clone**

To first retrieve work from a remote, you **clone** the repository onto your local computer.

Now you have a working copy, including the entire project history tracked by Git.

---

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Pull**/**Push**

Next, you'll want your local version to 'speak' seamlessly with the remote.  

A typical workflow:

  + You **pull** from a remote repository to make sure you have the latest version of everything locally.
  + You do some work, and commit it.
  + You **push** your new commits back to the remote repository so that it's backed up there and your collaborators can access it.
  
---

# Basic Git shell commands

First: why bother?
+ RStudio's Git integration and built-in GUI cover all the major operations.
+ But the shell is more powerful and flexible, and it's good to understand what is going on underneath the hood.

--

Clone a repo.

```bash
$ git clone REPOSITORY-URL
```

See the commit history (hit spacebar to scroll down or 'q' to exit)

```bash
$ git log
```

What has changed?

```bash
$ git status
```

---

# Basic Git shell commands (cont'd)

Stage ("add") a file or group of files

```bash
$ git add README.md # Name of file or folder.
```

There are a bunch of useful 'flag' options too:

  + Stage all files

  ```bash
  $ git add -A
  ```
  
  + Stage updated files only (modified or deleted, but not new).
  
  ```bash
  $ git add -u
  ```
  
  + Stage new files only (not updated)
  
  ```bash
  $ git add .
  ```

---

# Basic Git shell commands (cont'd)

Commit your changes.

```bash
$ git commit -m "I made these changes."
```

Pull from the upstream repository (i.e. Github).

```bash
$ git pull
```

(Maybe you have to fix some **Merge Conflicts**)

Push any local changes that you've committed to the upstream repo.
  
```bash
$ git push
```

# Branches and Pull Requests

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>
---

# What are Branches?

+ **Branches** allow you to have multiple versions of your work, and lets you track each version systematically.

+ Branches allow you to take a snapshot of your existing repo and try out a whole new idea *without affecting* your `main`<sup>1</sup> branch.

.font80[.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> The default branch name in Git used `main`; it used to be called `master`, which you might still see on some legacy repositories. You can also rename the `main` branch.]]

--

+ Once you (and your collaborators) are 100% satisfied with the new work, you can **merge** the new branch back into the main branch.

  - This is how most new features in modern software and apps are developed.
  - Helps to catch and fix bugs.
  - Researchers - like us! - can easily use this feature to try out new ideas and analyses (e.g., experimental modeling, requested revisions, etc)

+ If you aren't happy with an experimental branch, just delete it, safe with the knowledge that your precious main branch will be unaffected.

---

# What are Branches?

At its core, a **branch** is a movable label attached to a commit.

A **merge** is a combination of two or more branches; i.e., a special commit that is a combination of all the commits from both branches.

[Conceptually, this is what a project with multiple branches looks like.](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans?slide=55)

How do we create a new branch in RStudio?

(Marcus will create another gif and post it in the slides, don't worry.)

---

# Branches in the Shell

Creating a new branch is simple in the shell.

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-new-idea
```

Push the new branch to the remote on Github (called `origin`).

```bash
$ git push origin my-new-idea
```

Switch back to the `main` branch

```bash
$ git checkout main
```

List all of the branches in your repository

```bash
$ git branch
 *main # A star will appear beside the branch that you're currently in
  my-new-idea
```

# Merging Branches

<div align="center">

</div>

---

# Merging Branches

There are two options:

## 1. Locally

+ Commit your final changes in the new branch (`my-new-idea`)
+ Switch back to the `main` branch:
  ```bash
  $ git checkout main
  ```
+ Merge the two:
  ```bash
  $ git merge my-new-idea main
  ```
+ Delete my-new-idea (optional):
  ```bash
  $ git branch -d my-new-idea
  ```
  
---

# Merging Branches

There are two options:

## 2. Remotely (i.e. *pull requests* on Github)

+ **Pull Requests** (PRs) are a great way to notify collaborators - or yourself! - that you have completed a feature.
+ You write a summary of all the changes contained in the branch.
+ You then assign suggested reviewers of your code - including yourself potentially! - who are then able to approve these changes ("Merge pull request") on Github.

# Group Exercise!

### Try to do the following in the breakout rooms:

<br>

1. Create a new branch in your test repository.

2. In the new branch, make some local changes, commit, then push them to Github.

3. Head over to the repo on Github

  + You should see a new green button "Compare and pull request". Click it.
  + Add a meta description of what this PR accomplishes. 
  + Click "Create pull request".
  + (Here's where you or your collaborators would review all the changes.)
  + Once satisfied, click "Merge pull request and then confirm"

Congrats! You've made your first PR!

# Forks

(one last term to learn!!)

**Forking** is kind of a hybrid between cloning a repo and branching from it.

When you fork an existing repository, you create an *independent* copy of it under your own Github account.

Once you fork a repo, you are free to do anything you want to it. It's yours!

--

Forking, in combination with PRs, is a powerful way to develop software (and other research projects). For example:

+ An enterprising graduate student in the Bayne Lab (!!!) wants to add a new feature (or fix a bug they've identified) to the ABMI's [`wildRtrax` R package](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildRtrax).

+ They can fork the repo where wildRtrax is hosted, add the code required, and then issue an [upstream pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
+ The maintainer of the package is notified and can then decide whether to merge the contribution with the main project.

# Project Organization

### Why should we have consistent projects?

--

<br>

+ Consistent file/folder structure provides you with clues to where information is stored.

+ If standardized across multiple people, improves reproducibility among users.

+ Can include updates to your .gitignore to prevent data from accidentally being committed/pushed.

# Code Organization

### Why should we aim for clean code?

+ Improves legibility when revisting code base or sharing with others.

+ Some further reading:

  - [A call to clean code to effectively communicate science](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13961)

  - [A Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf)

# Code Organization

### Common Themes

<br>

+ Use **relative** paths to file instead of **absolute** ones.
  - `"~/data/raw/amphibian-data.Rdata"` (relative) Nice!
  - `"C:/users/memyself&irene/desktop/amphibians/data/raw/amphibian-data.Rdata"` (absolute) Mean!
  - Remember, an angel loses their wings every time you use the latter.<sup>1</sup>
  
<br>

.font80[.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> This is one way in which RStudio Projects are great: the .Rproj file acts as an anchor point for all other files in the repo.]]

--

+ Use sequential names for code files.
  - 01_data-processing.R; 02_glm-models.R (good!)
  - cleaning.R; model.R (not so good!)

---

# Code Organization

### Common Themes

<br>

+ Don't repeat yourself.
  - Defining functions vs. Copy pasting code chunks within/among projects.
  
--

<br>

+ Consistency.
  - 01_data-processing.R
  - 1_DataProcessing.R

# Github Pages

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>

---

# Github Pages

What are they?

+ Custom static webpages hosted through Github.
+ Ideal for creating technical documentation associated with a repository (e.g., [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) documents)
+ Can also be used to create simple websites to highlight your work (e.g., through Jekyll)

--

The ABMI is beginning to use bookdown to document modeling for various taxa; e.g., [Amphibian Modeling](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/Amphibians/).

---

# Github Pages

### Jekyll

+ Content is created through HTML and CSS code.
+ Allows for more complex websites to be built but is more challenging to learn.
