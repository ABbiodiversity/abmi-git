# Git (in theory)

A **version control system** is a tool that manages changes made to files and directories in a project.

Many exist, but we'll focus on a particularly powerful one: **Git**.
> If Dropbox and Word's *Track Changes* feature had a baby, Git would be that baby.

Git manages the evolution of a set of files in a highly structured way.

Originally created to help groups of people develop software.

--

<br>
Why's it useful to us?

+ Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, unless you work really hard at it.
+ Synchronizes work done by different people on different machines (i.e., a method to manage a *distributed* workflow)
+ Well designed for writing and tracking changes to code.

---

# Key Git Terms (1)

### **Repository**

Git projects have two parts: the files and directories you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 

The combination of these two things is called a **repository**, or *repo* as the cool kids say. 

### **Commit**

You use Git to take snapshots of all the files in a repository.

When you want to take a snapshot of a file or files, you create a **commit**.

<br>
So [why would I want to do this](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans?slide=23) silly commit thing instead of just regular 'ol saving?

---

# Commit (cont'd)

When you **commit** a file or files, some information is saved along with the changes to the file:

1. Who
2. When

Plus, you can (should!) add more information about the changes you've made in a **commit message**.

What's this look like?

--

<div align="right">
<img src="pics/commit.PNG" height=250>
</div>

---

# Commit (cont'd)

You can also browse the entire **commit history** of a project.

---

# Commit (cont'd)

<div align="center">
<img src="pics/useless-git.png" height=500>
</div>

---

# Key benefits (so far)

<br>
- Git stores the whole history of your project in a highly structured way.

- You can time travel to previous versions of your project if you need to.

---

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Remote**

You should back up your work regularly, ideally somewhere geographically distinct from your computer.

With Git, repositories can be local (on your machine) or **remote**, i.e. hosted online by a service like Github (which we'll chat about right away).

How do you interact with a remote repository?

--

### **Clone**

To first retrieve work from a remote, you **clone** the repository onto your local computer.

Now you have a working copy, including the entire project history tracked by Git.

---

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Pull**/**Push**<sup>1</sup>

Next, you'll want your local version to 'speak' seamlessly with the remote.  

A typical workflow:

  + You **pull** from a remote repository to make sure you have the latest version of everything locally.
  + You do some work, and commit it.
  + You **push** your new commits back to the remote repository so that it's backed up there and your collaborators can access it.

<br>
.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> These two commands were intentionally ordered in this way - it's good practice to Pull before you start work on a project, then Push when you're finished, even if you're working alone. If (when) you forget, there will be pain. Best to get in the habit.]

# Github

**Git and Github are distinct things.**

  + [Github](https://www.github.com) is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system<sup>1</sup>.
  
  + We can create, manage permissions to, and store our files in repositories hosted by Github.
  
  + Just like we don't *need* RStudio to run R code, we don't *need* Github to use Git - but it makes our lives much easier.

# Github for Scientific Research

In addition to the benefits of rigorous version control and collaboration tool, Git(hub) also helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility.

  +  *Nature:* [Democratic databases: science on GitHub](https://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719) (Perkel, 2016).
  + *PLOS:* [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and Github](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) (Perez-Riverol et al 2016)
  
Journals are increasingly moving towards stricter requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. 

  + No more frustrating reads of a tiny Methods section in a dusty old pdf file of a paper where you're trying desparately to understand what they did, step-by-step (.. *breathes heavily* ..).
  + You can host all the data, code, and writing for papers, projects, and/or reports in one place. Even [workshop materials](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/cure4git).

---

# Key benefits

<br>
- Git stores the whole history of your project in a highly structured way.

- You can time travel to previous versions of your project if you need to.

- Use remote repositories to back up your project.

- **Plenty of collaboration tools offered via Github** 

- **Ability to share your work with the world!**

> Much like the battle of Helm's Deep, this will likely involve some up front pain. But you will emerge victorious.  

---

# Getting Started

.font80[Note: there are a ton of great Git resources online to you walk you through this process in depth. A bunch are listed in the [Resources](#resources) section at the back of this presentation and in the workshop's repo [README file](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/cure4git/blob/master/README.md), many of which are heavily borrowed from for this presentation.] 

### Register for a [Github](https://www.github.com) account.

  - It's free! Don't worry about the paid accounts for now<sup>1</sup>.

### Install Git on your local machine.

  - Depends on the OS you're running, but we'll assume Windows for this tutorial.
  - [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), aka 'Git Bash', is a recommended approach.
  
.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> You'll qualify for an educational account while you're at the UofA, which means you can create an unlimited number of private repos.]
  
---

# Getting Started

### Introduce yourself to Git.

Directly in the Shell (Git Bash):

```{shell}
$ git config --global user.name 'Marcus Becker'
$ git config --global user.email 'mabecker@ualberta.ca'
```
  
Or through R:

```{r}

# install.packages("usethis")
  
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Marcus Becker", 
               user.email = "mabecker@ualberta.ca")
```

<br>
<br>
Tips: Use your (real) full name, and the email associated with your Github account.

# Seamless Integration 

A wonderful aspect of RStudio is how well it integrates version control into your project workflow.

Git is a separate program to R, but RStudio connects them so well that you feel they are part of the same ecosystem.

You can use Git through the RStudio GUI, and in the background it executes the shell commands for you.

# General Recipe

*For new projects*

1. Create a repo on GitHub and initialize with a README.

1. Copy the HTTPS link (access vis the green "Clone or Download" button).

1. In RStudio, create a new Project using the following steps: 

  `File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git` 
  
  and **clone** the repo to your local machine by pasting your copied link into the "Repository URL:" box.
  
1. Choose the project path (be intentional!) and click **Create Project**.

# General Recipe

We've now cloned a remote repo from Github onto our local machine. Yay!

Remember those other important command terms? (**Commit, Pull**, and **Push**) <br>
Let's execute them (Well, let RStudio execute them for us). 

.font90[1. Make a change to the repo README in RStudio ("Hello World!"). Save it.

1. Click the 'Git' tab in the `Environments, History, Connections .. ` pane.

1. Click `Commit`.

1. Click the `Stage` checkbox of the change you want to commit. 

  + You'll see a nice display of the changes you've either added (green) or deleted (red).

1. Write a `Commit message`. Be detailed. You never know when you'll need to know what you did in a particular commit. Commit the change.

1. Click `Pull` to retrieve any changes made by you or a collaborator in the upstream Github repo.

1. Click `Push`, which will send your changes to the remote repo on Github.]

# Recap

### What did we just do?

.font80[
+ Made some changes to a file locally 
+ Staged these changes 
+ Committed these local changes to our Git history
+ Pulled from the remote repo upstream
+ Pushed our shiny new changes out into the remote repo, accessible to our collaborators
]

--

### Why this workflow?

.font80[
+ Allows Github to act as the central node in the distributed version control network.
+ Copying project from Github to your machine automatically sets up the local Git repo for you.
+ RStudio Projects interact seamlessly with Git and Github.
  - e.g. The .RProj file acts as an anchor point for all other files in the repo, solving absolute vs. relative path problems<sup>1</sup>.

# What the Shell?!

What's RStudio doing in the background? 

It's executing a series of commands for you. But you can do these yourself.

There's a lot of terms that get thrown around: *shell, terminal, tty, command prompt*, etc.

+ They're basically just different names for the same thing (kind of).
+ They all refer to a **command line interface**.

You can type commands to your computer directly, rather than relying on a GUI. 

<br>
Why bother with the shell?

+ The shell is more powerful and flexible. You can do more.
+ Potentially more appropriate for projects that aren't (entirely) based in R.
+ Scripting with the shell is reproducible, while clicking within a GUI is not.
--
<br>
+ **You feel like a programming badass.** 

---

# What the Shell?!

There are many shell variants, but we'll focus on [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) (i.e. **B**ourne-**a**gain **sh**ell).

+ Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
+ Windows users should have it installed via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

When you open up the Bash shell, you'll be greeted by:
```bash
username@hostname: ~
$ 
```

# Repo tips

## README.md

+ You have the option to include a README when you create a repo in Github - do so!
+ README files act as landing pages for the repo, so you can (should) be explicit about the goals of the project/research, how to the run the analysis, etc. 
+ README's are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which Github automatically renders nicely for us.

## .gitignore

+ Tell Git what you want to ... ignore.
+ Useful if you have private files you would prefer not to be public (e.g. confidential data).
+ Or for very large individual files (>100 MB). These will cause RStudio to 'hang' (i.e. freeze up) when you try to push them to a remote repo<sup>1</sup>, which you don't want.
+ Just a simple text file (save as .gitignore) in which you write the files you want ignored.  

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> There are [ways to handle large files](https://git-lfs.github.com/) when you're working in the shell, though.]

---

# Parting Thoughts

+ You may retain just 10% of what I talked about here today. That's okay. See [Resources](#resources) page.

--

+ [Jump into the pool!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) Learning is by doing.

--

+ If you want to work in a data science role, learning to use Git will be of huge value to you.

--

+ Decorate your Github profile page with some personal information (no one wants to hire a bar code). 
  - Pin the repositories with your best work. Show off what you can do!
  
--
  
+ Use Github to look at [other people's code](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/OSM-Synthesis-YERA), and learn from them. Clone a repo that interests you and track its evolution.
