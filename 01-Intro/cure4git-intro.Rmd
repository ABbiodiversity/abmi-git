# Outline of these workshops

## Workshop 2 (October 24, 2019)

- Troubleshoot issues that inevitably arise 

- Go through some more advanced Git operations and workflows:

  + Conflicts
  + Branches
  + Forking

## Workshop 3 (TBD)

- Discuss practices and procedures for using Git in ABMI workflow

  + Github organization, teams, and permissions.
  + etc.

# Prologue

## The Highest Ideal

> *The goal is a collaborative, transparent, and efficient approach to our scientific and computational work at the ABMI.* 


<br>
Part of this process will be figuring out how best to structure a collaborative culture within the organization (and with external partners).

We want to operationalize the **reproducibility** of our research.

<br>

So there isn't a 'right' way for now, but hopefully it will develop over time where staff from all corners of the organization can contribute to and review the scientific products were generate.  

---

# Going Forward

**The Plan** (capital T capital P) is to:

1. Build skills with git software among staff

  + Develop curated list of Help resources
  + Develop a nucleus of staff who can consistently provide support to others
  + Meet (semi-) regularly to continue skill development 

1. Introduce git to the workflow of a few projects identified as good candidates

1. Over time, build our analyses using git as a collaboration tool and version control backstop, accessible by others both within and outside of the organization.

  ... something, something ...

1. Conquer the world!

# Git(hub) solves this problem

### Git

- Git is a powerful distributed<sup>1</sup> version control system.
> If Dropbox and Word's 'Track Changes' feature had a baby, Git would be that baby.

- Extremely useful for writing and tracking changes to code.

### Github

- Git and Github are distinct things.
  + Github is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system (other example as Gitlab and Bitbucket).
  + Just like we don't *need* RStudio to run R code, we don't *need* Github to use Git - but it makes our lives much easier.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Doesn't require a centralized server to host the repository.]

# Git(hub) for scientific research

- Besides the benefits of git as a rigorous version control and collaboration tool, Git(hub) also helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility.

  +  *Nature:* "[Democratic databases: science on GitHub](https://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719)" (Perkel, 2016).

# Glossary of Terms

Some commonly used terms to learn:

- **Repository** (aka a 'repo' in cool kids slang.)

A file location where all the files related to a project are stored.

- **Commit**

The commit command is used to save your changes (text writing, code, new files ... anything) to the local repository.  

- **Push / Pull**

You *push* the changes you've made to your local repository to a remote repository. 

You *pull* any changes made in the remote repository (e.g. by your collaborators) to your local one.

# Getting Started

### Register for a [Github](www.github.com) account.

  - It's free! Don't worry about the paid accounts for now<sup>1</sup>.

### Install Git on your local machine.

  - Depends on the OS you're running, but we'll assume Windows for this tutorial.
  - [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), aka 'Git Bash', is a desirable approach.

<sup>1</sup> You'll qualify for an educational account while you work for ABMI/UofA.]

# Getting Started

### Introduce yourself to Git.

Directly in the Shell:
  
```
$ git config --global user.name 'Marcus Becker'
$ git config --global user.email 'mabecker@ualberta.ca`
```
Or through R:

```r
# install.packages("usethis")
  
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Marcus Becker", 
               user.email = "mabecker@ualberta.ca")
```

Tips: Use your (real) full name, and

# General Recipe

- Create a new R-Project using the following steps: 

`File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git`
