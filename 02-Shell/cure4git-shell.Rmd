# What the Shell?!

So, there's lot of terms that get thrown around: *shell, terminal, tty, command prompt*, etc.

+ They're basically just different names for the same thing.

+ They all refer to a **command line interface** (CLI). 


---

# Bash (i.e. Bourne Again Shell)



---

# Use Shell Commands

```bash
git status # Discover which file(s) have been changed since the last save.

git diff # Look at changes.

```

This is a change.

```bash

git add FILENAME # Add file to staging area.

git commit -m "this is a message"

git log # press spacebar to continue down.

```

---

Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a hash. 

```bash
$ git log # retrieve hash

$ git show # enter first few characters of a hash, or HEAD~X

$ git annotate FILE # shows a list of all the changes to that particular file
```
---

# How can I see what changed between two commits?

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~2 # can use the hash characters here as well.

```

---

# Flags

+ `-r` to compare to a particular revision

+ `-ammend` to change the previous commit message

```bash
$ ls -lh ~/Documents/
```


---

# Text editors

Nano

```bash

nano FILENAME

```
