# Git - The Basics

[Slides](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/cure4git/cure4git-intro.html#1) for the first workshop.

+ Git is a **version control system** that manages changes made to files and directories in a project.
+ Originally created to help groups of people develop software.
+ Git manages the evolution of a set of files in a highly structured way.

--
<br>
### Why's it useful to us?

+ Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, unless you work really hard at it.
+ Synchronizes work done by different people on different machines (i.e., a method to manage a *distributed* workflow)
+ Well designed for writing and tracking changes to code.
+ Helps us back up, share, and conduct QA on our analyses and products.

# Key Git Terms (1)

### **Repository**

Git projects have two parts: the files and directories you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 

The combination of these two things is called a **repository**, or *repo* as the cool kids say. 

### **Commit**

You use Git to take snapshots of all the files in a repository.

When you want to take a snapshot of a file or files, you create a **commit**.

<br>
So [why would I want to do this](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans?slide=23) silly commit thing instead of just regular 'ol saving?

---

# Commit (cont'd)

When you **commit** a file or files, some information is saved along with the changes to the file:

1. Who
2. When

Plus, you can (should!) add more information about the changes you've made in a **commit message**.

What's this look like?

</div>

---

# Commit (cont'd)

You can also browse the entire **commit history** of a project.

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Remote**

With Git, repositories can be local (on your machine) or **remote**, i.e. hosted online by a service like Github.

How do you interact with a remote repository?

--

### **Clone**

To first retrieve work from a remote, you **clone** the repository onto your local computer.

Now you have a working copy, including the entire project history tracked by Git.

---

# Key Git Terms (2)

### **Pull**/**Push**

Next, you'll want your local version to 'speak' seamlessly with the remote.  

A typical workflow:

  + You **pull** from a remote repository to make sure you have the latest version of everything locally.
  + You do some work, and commit it.
  + You **push** your new commits back to the remote repository so that it's backed up there and your collaborators can access it.

# Merge Conflicts

Brandon and I decide to collaborate on a project.

+ Brandon: Invites Marcus to join as a collaborator on the Github repo<sup>1</sup>.

+ Marcus: Clones the repo to his local machine, so that they both now have an up-to-date working copy.

Now we both have access and are working simultaneously on files within the repo (e.g. the code, report writing, etc), and **conflicts** may arise.

.font80[.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Can be done via the 'Settings' tab in any Github repo, then 'Collaborators & teams'. A collaborator will have **write** access to a repo, i.e. they can push/pull.]]

--

+ Brandon: Makes some edits to a file (README, in this case), then proceeds to stage, commit, and push these changes.

+ Marcus: Meanwhile, he also makes changes to the README and attempts to stage, commit, and push them (*after* pulling from the Github repo first).

**What happens?**

# Merge Conflicts

Marcus encounters a `merge conflict` error.

Let's confirm what's going on.

```bash
$ git status
```

As part of the response, he should see something like:
```bash
Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
  
   * both modified:   README.md 
```
Git is protecting Marcus by refusing the merge. It wants to make sure that he doesn't accidentally overwrite all of his changes by pulling Brandon's version of the README.

- In this case, the source of the problem was obvious. Once we start working on bigger projects, however, `git status` can provide a helpful summary to see which files are in conflict.
