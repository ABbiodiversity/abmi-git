# Prologue

## The Highest Ideal

> *The goal is a collaborative, transparent, and efficient approach to our computational work at the ABMI.* 

<br>

Part of this process will be figuring out how best to structure a collaborative culture within the organization (and with external partners).

We want to operationalize open science and the **reproducibility** of our research.

<br>

So there isn't a "right" way for now, but hopefully it will develop over time.

> "Start as you mean to go."

# Going Forward

The plan is to:

1. Build skills with git software.

2. Find projects to incorporate git into the workflow.

3. Develop a nucleus of staff who can consistently provide support for others to learn.

4. Over time, build our analyses using a git workflow, accessible by others both within and outside of the organization.

5. Conquer the world!

# Git(hub) solves this problem

### Git

- Git is a powerful distributed<sup>1</sup> version control system.
> If Dropbox and Word's 'Track Changes' feature had a baby, Git would be that baby.

- Git is optimized for writing code.

### Github

- Git and Github are distinct things.
  + Github is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system.<sup>2</sup>
  + Just like we don't *need* RStudio to run R code, we don't *need* Github to use Git.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Doesn't require a centralized server to host the repository. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Other examples are Gitlab and Bitbucket.

# Git(hub) for scientific research

- Besides the benefits of git as a rigorous version control (VC) and collaboration tool, Git(hub) also helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility.

- *Nature:* "[Democratic databases: science on GitHub](https://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719)" (Perkel, 2016).

# General Recipe

- Create a new R-Project using the following steps: `File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git`
